# 🧬 HealthLLM – Biomedical Question Answering with LLMs

**HealthLLM** is an ongoing project focused on building a system that leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to retrieve, embed, and generate context-aware answers from biomedical literature. The system integrates **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques with scientific articles sourced from the **PubMed Central (PMC) API**, with the aim of supporting intelligent search and question answering in the healthcare domain.

## 🚧 Project Status

This project is currently in active development. Initial stages involve designing the architecture, implementing document retrieval pipelines, and preparing for embedding and vector-based search.

## 🎯 Goals

- ✅ Retrieve biomedical literature using the **PMC API**
- 🧠 Convert articles into high-quality **text embeddings**
- 🔎 Enable **semantic search** through vector databases
- 🧾 Implement a **RAG pipeline** to provide grounded answers using LLMs
- 📦 Package the system with a lightweight API or frontend for easy interaction

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned & In Use)

- **Language Models**: OpenAI GPT, Hugging Face Transformers  
- **Embeddings**: SentenceTransformers, OpenAI Embeddings  
- **Vector Databases**: FAISS, Weaviate (planned)  
- **Data Retrieval**: PMC API (Entrez), XML parsing  
- **RAG Frameworks**: LangChain, LLamaIndex (planned)  
- **Interface**: Streamlit or FastAPI (planned)  
- **Languages**: Python 3  
- **Tools**: Jupyter, Git

## 📚 Use Cases

- Biomedical Q&A for students, researchers, or clinicians  
- Literature-based evidence generation  
- Semantic search in scientific databases  
- Support for systematic reviews or hypothesis generation

## 🤝 Contributing

HealthLLM is in its early stages but open to feedback, suggestions, or collaboration ideas — especially in the areas of biomedical NLP, model evaluation, and data quality control.
